Hi! I'm Charlton Trezevant

I'm an IT major who's very involved in both [HackUCF](https://hackucf.org) and [TechKnights](https://techknights.org), and this is my third year UCF. I'm very glad to meet you all!

If you'd like a copy of the slide deck, as well as a collection of very useful links, head over [here](https://www.ctis.me/s/git) for supplementary materials.

If you have any questions, need help, or want to learn more, feel free to [message me on Discord](https://hachucf.org/discord/) (I'm `@charlton#9799`) or reach out [via email](https://www.ctis.me).

I hope you enjoy this workshop, and that the content is helpful and improves your life. Thanks for coming!
